To run linear method example on propene 
  (STO-3G basis, single-Slater Jastrow wavefunction)
  
  from MolSSI-portfolio/ run:
	>> python linear_method/linear_method.py

1.) Divergence check on the current iteration (second update calc) 
    is run by comparing the new energy to the previous energy
	that has been provided (likewise with the corresponding standard 
	error). 
	IF new energy > 4*standard error of the previous iteration,
	 calculation is diverged and a new update step from the previous 
	 LM calculation is made.
	ELSE go onto take linear method step

2.) Linear method step is calculated, using the internal_options_dict 
    for this current iterations calculation and the accumulated LM
	terms from sample (in acc_dict)

In this example, the energy has NOT diverged and the LM step will be 
immediately calculated
