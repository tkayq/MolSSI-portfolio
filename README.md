# Graduate Student Code Samples – MolSSI Software Fellowship 

This repository showcases selected C++ and Python code samples from two of my research projects completed in my PhD thus far, developed as part of my application for the [MolSSI Software Fellowship for Graduate Students](https://molssi.org/fellowship/).


Both projects are involve method development within variational Monte Carlo (VMC) a stochastic quantum chemistry method that 
- [`linear_method/`](linear_method/) — Implementation of the linear method, a quasi-second order optimizer in VMC, designed for orbital optimization of a VMC trail wavefunction [1,2].
- [`cusp_orbitals/`](cusp_orbitals/) — An electron-nuclear cusp correction scheme for Gaussian orbitals [2].

Both projects contain a Python and C++ sample taken from the Neuscamman Group in-house codebase: ESSQC.
