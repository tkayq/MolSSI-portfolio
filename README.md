# MolSSI Fellowship Application - Software Examples

This repository showcases selected C++ and Python code samples from two of my research projects completed in my PhD thus far, developed as part of my application for the [MolSSI Software Fellowship for Graduate Students](https://molssi.org/fellowship/).

I leave the description of the software examples to the detailed document that led you here.

Thank you!
